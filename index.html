      <h2>About me</h2>
      <span>
        Hi, here I will tell you a little about myself. I want to be a
        professional developer, constantly develop and learn new technologies.
        Now the task is to study the frontend, but in the future I plan to study
        the backend as well. My strengths are that I am fascinated by the
        development process itself. That is, a kind of "masachism" in
        programming, when everything fails and I can't solve the problem, and I
        don't even know how to do it. This motivates me to look for and come up
        with algorithms and ways to solve the problem. And of course that
        feeling of euphoria when I was able to solve the problem). I don't have
        much experience, except that I can add a Python certificate, I'm also
        currently studying HTML and CSS on my own, I have basic skills working
        with the Git version control system. Currently, my experience is daily
        work in self-study of technology and, of course, your course.
        Unfortunately, there is not much time left for studying now, but I try
        to devote every free minute to programming.
