        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p class="about-desc">
          Hi, here I will tell you a little about myself. I want to be a
          professional developer, constantly develop and learn new technologies.
          Now the task is to study the frontend, but in the future I plan to
          study the backend as well. My strengths are that I am fascinated by
          the development process itself. That is, a kind of "masachism" in
          programming, when everything fails and I can't solve the problem, and
          I don't even know how to do it. This motivates me to look for and come
          up with algorithms and ways to solve the problem. And of course that
          feeling of euphoria when I was able to solve the problem). I don't
          have much experience, except that I can add a Python certificate, I'm
          also currently studying HTML and CSS on my own, I have basic skills
          working with the Git version control system. Currently, my experience
          is daily work in self-study of technology and, of course, your course.
          Unfortunately, there is not much time left for studying now, but I try
          to devote every free minute to programming.

        <h2>Code examples 'Codewars'</h2>

        <p>
          Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of
          this number within an array in reverse order.
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code>function digitize(n) {
            let a = (Array.from(String(n), Number)).reverse(); 
            return a; 
        }</code>
            </pre>
